                New York-based Loadsmart has involved EGGS since its early days as a start-up to reinvent transportation logistics through intelligent technology and meaningful design. In many ways comparable with
                “Uber for trucks,” Loadsmart has experimented with various ways to connect drivers and carriers with shippers and goods.
                EGGS has contributed to service design, user experience, digital design, branding, positioning, visual identity, and communication.
                Loadsmart launched its platform in August 2015 for invited carriers and opened officially to the public in December 2016.
